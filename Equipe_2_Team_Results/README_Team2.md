The number of retracted scientific publications has increased significantly in recent years, raising questions about the causes of this trend. This study analyzed 2,047 retracted articles indexed in PubMed, focusing on the time interval between publication and retraction (time-to-retraction). The average time-to-retraction was 32.91 months, with articles published before 2002 taking longer to retract (49.82 months) compared to those published after 2002 (23.82 months). This suggests quicker retractions in recent years, though recent flawed articles may not yet be recognized.

The study examined the relationship between time-to-retraction and journal impact factor (IF), finding that high-IF journals retract articles more quickly, but this explained only 1% of the variance. The correlation was stronger for articles retracted due to misconduct, especially fraud, but remained modest overall. This indicates that while scrutiny in prominent journals contributes, it does not fully explain the increase in retractions.

The analysis also revealed shifts in retraction causes, with plagiarism and duplicate publication becoming more frequent. Plagiarism, first recorded in 1979, now accounts for 9.4% of retractions but remains less common than fraud or error. Retractions are occurring earlier in an article’s life cycle, reflecting changes in institutional and editorial policies aimed at preserving scientific integrity.

Additionally, the rise in retractions is driven by authors with a single retraction, who have become more prominent. From 1993 to 2012, 63.1% of retracted papers were by authors with one retraction, compared to 46% from 1972 to 1992. This shift suggests retractions are now more broadly distributed across the scientific community.

In conclusion, the rise in retractions reflects changes in author and institutional behavior, highlighting the need for continued vigilance in maintaining scientific integrity.
