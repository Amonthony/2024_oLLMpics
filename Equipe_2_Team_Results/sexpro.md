Proposal for High-Throughput Sex Determination in Cannabis Using REM16 and FT1
Objective: Develop a robust and scalable method for sex determination in Cannabis sativa utilizing transcriptomic markers REM16 and FT1.

Workflow:

Sample Collection:

Collect leaf samples from cannabis plants at an early vegetative stage (4-6 weeks old).
Store samples in RNA-preserving solution to maintain RNA integrity.
RNA Extraction:

Use a standardized RNA extraction kit to isolate total RNA from collected samples.
Quantify and assess RNA quality using spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis.
cDNA Synthesis and qPCR:

Synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) from RNA using reverse transcription.
Perform quantitative PCR (qPCR) with specific primers for REM16 and FT1.
Include controls for sex determination, using known male and female samples for comparison.
Data Analysis:

Analyze qPCR results using relative expression levels of REM16 and FT1.
Establish thresholds for distinguishing between male and female samples based on expression patterns.
Scaling to High-Throughput:

Utilize a multi-well plate format for simultaneous analysis of multiple samples.
Implement automated liquid handling systems for sample processing.
Integrate software for data acquisition and analysis to facilitate large-scale screening.
Outcome: This high-throughput method enables rapid and accurate determination of cannabis plant sex, supporting efficient breeding programs and enhancing cultivation strategies.
