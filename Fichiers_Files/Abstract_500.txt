**Abstract:**

The number of retracted scientific publications has risen dramatically over recent years, prompting questions about the underlying causes of this trend. It is unclear whether this increase is due to a higher volume of flawed articles being published or improvements in the detection and removal of problematic papers. To explore this issue, we analyzed 2,047 retracted articles indexed in PubMed, focusing on trends in the time interval between publication and retraction (time-to-retraction). The average time-to-retraction across all articles was 32.91 months. However, articles published before 2002 took significantly longer to retract (49.82 months) compared to those published after 2002 (23.82 months, p < 0.0001). This suggests that journals are now retracting articles more quickly than in the past, although the possibility remains that recent flawed articles may not yet have been recognized for retraction.

To assess the role of increased scrutiny, we examined the relationship between time-to-retraction and journal impact factor (IF). While high-IF journals tended to retract articles more quickly, this factor explained only 1% of the variance in retraction time. The correlation was stronger for articles retracted due to misconduct, especially fraud, but still modest overall. Therefore, while greater scrutiny in prominent journals may play a role, it does not fully explain the observed increase in retractions.

Our analysis also revealed shifts in the causes for retraction. Retractions for previously rare offenses such as plagiarism and duplicate publication have become more frequent, indicating that the grounds for retraction have expanded. The first recorded retraction for plagiarism occurred in 1979, with plagiarism now accounting for 9.4% of all retractions. Nonetheless, retractions for plagiarism are still relatively uncommon compared to those for fraud or error. Additionally, the study found that retractions are more likely to occur earlier in the articleâ€™s life cycle, with a progressive decline in time-to-retraction for articles published since 2000. This points to lowered barriers to retraction, which may reflect changes in institutional and editorial policies aimed at preserving the integrity of the scientific literature.

Another factor driving the rise in retractions is the behavior of authors with a single retraction, who have become more prominent in recent decades. From 1993 to 2012, 63.1% of retracted papers were written by authors with only one retraction, compared to 46% from 1972 to 1992 (p < 0.001). In contrast, authors with multiple retractions had a greater influence in the earlier period but contributed less proportionally to the recent surge in retractions. This shift suggests that retractions are now more broadly distributed across the scientific community rather than being concentrated among a few prolific offenders.

In conclusion, the rise in retractions reflects changes in the behavior of both authors and institutions. Lower barriers to publication of flawed articles are evidenced by the increase in retractions by authors with a single retraction, while lower barriers to retraction are indicated by the shorter time-to-retraction and the expansion of retraction criteria to include offenses such as plagiarism. These findings underscore the importance of continued vigilance in maintaining the integrity of the scientific record.
