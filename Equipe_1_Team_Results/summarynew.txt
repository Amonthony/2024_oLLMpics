The number of retracted scientific publications has increased significantly in recent years, raising questions about the underlying causes. A study analyzed 2,047 retracted articles in PubMed, focusing on trends in the time interval between publication and retraction (time-to-retraction). The average time-to-retraction was 32.91 months, with articles published before 2002 taking significantly longer to retract than those published after 2002. The study found that while high-impact journals tend to retract articles more quickly, this factor only explains 1% of the variance in retraction time. The correlation was the stronger for articles retracted due to misconduct, especially fraud.
The study also revealed shifts in the causes for retraction, with retractions for previously rare offenses such as plagiarism and duplicate publication becoming more frequent. The first recorded retraction for plagiarism occurred in 1979, with plagiarism accounting for 9.4% of all retractions. From 1993 to 2012, 63.1% of retracted papers were written by authors with only one retraction, and authors with multiple retractions had a greater influence in the earlier period but contributed less proportionally to the recent surge in retractions. This shift suggests that retractions are now more broadly distributed across the scientific community rather than being concentrated among a few prolific offenders.
The rise in retractions reflects changes in the behavior of both authors and institutions. Lower barriers to publication of flawed articles are evidenced by the increase in retractions by authors with a single retraction, while shorter time-to-retraction and expanded retraction criteria to include offenses like plagiarism are also lower barriers.
